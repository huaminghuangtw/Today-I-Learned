# `crontab` v.s `cronjob`

**Crontab** stands for “cron table.” It is a Unix-based utility that provides a configuration file used by the **cron daemon** (`crond`), the background process that runs scheduled, automated tasks. The crontab file stores a list of cron jobs—each line represents a separate cron job.

A **cron job** is an individual task (e.g., running scripts, executing commands, etc.) specified/defined in the crontab file.

# Crontab Commands

* View current crontab entries:

	```bash
	crontab -l
	```

* Edit the crontab file:

	```bash
	crontab -e
	```

* Remove all crontab entries:

	```bash
	crontab -r
	```

# Cronjob Format

```bash
* * * * * command_to_execute
- - - - -
| | | | |
| | | | +----- Day of the week (0–7, where 0 or 7 is Sunday, 1 is Monday, etc.)
| | | +------- Month (1-12)
| | +--------- Day of the month (1-31)
| +----------- Hour (0-23)
