Today I learned

* **Search for an exact match:** enter a word or phrase inside quotes (quotation marks)
	* For example, `"tallest building"`
* **Search for a specific word and any synonyms for that word:** add a tilde in front of a word
	* For example, searching `iPhone ~cheap` will also show results for `iPhone inexpensive`, and so forth
* **Exclude words from your search:** add a dash (minus symbol) in front of a word that you want to leave out
	* For example, `jaguar speed -car`
* OR operator
	* Comparison
		* Searching `apple microsoft` will prioritize results where both words/terms are found together
			* Results will likely include both “apple” and “microsoft” somewhere on the page (not necessarily next to each other, but both terms will appear in the content)
		* Searching `apple OR microsoft` provides you with results that contain either “apple”, “microsoft” or both
			* More inclusive results: it’s not required for both to be present on a single page
	* The vertical bar `|` is a shorthand for the OR operator
* Range operator (two periods `..`)
	* For example
		* Number range
			* Searching `smartphones $200..$500` will surface results for smartphones priced between $200 and $500
		* Date range
			* Searching `olympics 2000..2020` will show results about the Olympics from the years 2000 to 2020
		* Measurements
			* Searching `cars 100..200 horsepower` will return cars that fall within that horsepower range
* **Search for a specific site:** add `site:` in front of a site or domain
	* For example, `site:youtube.com cat videos`
	* Or: [use Google’s custom search engine (CSE)](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/1gu6e3v/ysk_google_allows_you_to_make_a_custom_google)
* **Search for similar sites:** add `related:` in front of a site or domain
	* For example
		* Searching `related:amazon.com` brings up results including Walmart and Overstock
		* Searching `related:google.com` shows Yahoo and Bing
* **Search for a specific file type of uploaded files:** add `filetype:` or `ext:` in front of file types
	* For example
		* Use `filetype:pdf` to find a PDF
		* Use `ext:doc` to locate a Microsoft Office document
* `intilte`, `allintitle`, `intext`, `allintext`
